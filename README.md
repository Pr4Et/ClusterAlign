# ClusterAlign Client-Server
Alignment of S/TEM tilt series based on clusters of fiducial markers using a client-server approach <br />

For details: check the Client-Server folder. <br/> 
The client side is run from a single Python module main.py, where the settings are configured in the user manageable sections. It is easy to modify the code for scripts in batch processing. <br />
The client program requires a username and password of FTP site, which you may install on the server (see details in the Python code).<br />
